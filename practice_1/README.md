In its simplest form, R can be used as an interactive calculator. Type 5 + 7 and press Enter.

```R
5 + 7
[1] 12
```
To assign the result of 5 + 7 to a new variable called x, you type x <- 5 + 7. This can be read
as 'x gets 5 plus 7'. Give it a try now.

```R
x <- 5 + 7
```
To view the contents of the variable x, just type x and press Enter. Try it now.

```R
x
[1] 12
```

Now, store the result of x - 3 in a new variable called y.

```R
y <- x - 3
```

What is the value of y? Type y to find out.

```R
> y
[1] 9
```
